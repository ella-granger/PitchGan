## PitchGAN: A Conditional GAN Generating Pitch Curve for Singing Voice Synthesis
contact: huiranyu@andrew.cmu.edu
### Sound Examples

The sound examples are from four models: the proposed PitchGAN; PitchGAN trained with the sum of GAN loss and MSE loss; generator in PitchGAN trained with MSE loss; the CNN-LSTM baseline model. The original audios from an amatuer singer are also listed here for reference.
